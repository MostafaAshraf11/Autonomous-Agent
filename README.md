# Autonomous Agent
 An autonomous agent system built in Java that simulates an agent capable of constructing buildings in a virtual environment. The agent performs actions such as requesting resources (food, materials, energy), waiting for resource arrival, and building structures. The project leverages search algorithms like Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Uniform Cost Search (UCS) to make decisions and plan actions
 
## Overview

This Java project simulates an autonomous agent that performs tasks in a controlled environment. The agent can build two types of buildings, each requiring different resources: food, materials, and energy. The agentâ€™s actions are guided by search algorithms to effectively plan and execute tasks.

## Features

- **Resource Management**: The agent can request food, materials, and energy.
- **Building Construction**: The agent can build two types of buildings.
- **Action Constraints**: The agent must wait until requested resources are delivered before performing subsequent actions.
- **Search Algorithms**: Implements Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Uniform Cost Search (UCS) for decision-making and planning.
